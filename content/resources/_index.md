[Obsidian Roundup](https://obsidianroundup.org)

* There's a new share & showcase for [Note and metadata/YAML templates](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/note-and-metadata-yaml-templates-snippets-showcase/16953) that is intended to serve as a handy meta thread for dataview, templater ( see also: [this showcase](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/templater-plugin-script-collection/17010) from `@pmbauer`)), and daily notes templates. 
* Templater now has [a showcase on github](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater/discussions/categories/templates-showcase) where people can share useful templater scripts. `@Murf` also has some [gists](https://gist.github.com/GitMurf) that seem like useful templater scripts. 
* [Supercharged links](https://github.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links) allows for customization of internal links based on the target note's front-matter attributes. It also lets you trigger Array, Boolean and Number in front-matter values to style your internal links. There is a [showcase](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/supercharged-links-showcase/18219) on the forum. 
* There's a new [showcase for the buttons plugin](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/buttons-showcase/18044).
* `@foreveryone` maintains a useful [repository of snippets](https://github.com/gitobsidiantutorial?tab=repositories), as do `@dmitry` & `@klaas` [here](https://github.com/Dmitriy-Shulha/obsidian-css-snippets).
